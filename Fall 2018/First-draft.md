### Abstract

Stacked Rapid Sand Filtration is the last stage in an AguaClara treatment plant. It is used to further reduce the turbidity of water to match EPA standards of 0.3 NTU or less. In this report, we will be researching the effects of different sizes of sand grains as well as ranges of coagulant dosage. By experimenting with the previously stated variables, this will enhance our understanding of the ability of flocs to bind to the surface of the sand grains. Our goals for this semester is to find out the volume of flocs caught within the pores of the sand grains as well as formulating a mathematical model for calculating the depth of the active zone.

Sand filtration has been used since ancient times. In AguaClara water treatment plants, a common type of sand filtration is used - rapid (gravity) sand filtration. This filtration method requires the use of a chemical coagulant (PaCl) to aggregate small particles (flocs) to increase ease of particle filtration. The filter has proven to clean the water below 0.3 NTU, meeting the EPA standards. This can be found from experimentation performed on the model sand filter and sand filters in the water treatment plants built in Honduras.

The goal of the Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filtration Theory sub-team is to develop a mathematical model describing the filter performance. To do so, the relevant filtration parameters must be determined. After the parameters are determined, the filter performance can be optimized to establish low effluent turbidity and long filtration duration. Some examples of filter parameters considered in previous years were coagulant dosage, influent flow rate, influent turbidity, backwash duration, and floc size. The Fall 2018 team will explore the effects of sand grain size on filter performance.

The main goal of the Fall 2018 team is to investigate variation in sand grain size and create a corresponding mathematical model. The team currently has one StaRs filter will build 2 new StaRs filters identical to the filter we already have. Each of the 3 filters will be filled with the same volume of sand, but the sand grain size in each filter will differ. After construction, the filters will be tested and performance will be analyzed.

The team hypothesizes that the filter with the largest sand grains will have the shortest failure time. We expect that flocs will be deposited along the sand pores at the same rate in every filter because the rate of the influent stream will be held constant. However, the volume of the filter will be held constant, so when sand grain size increases, the amount of sand grain pores in the filter decreases. Ultimately, this means that for a filter filled with larger sand grains, there will be less sand pores active at one time. This is predicted to cause the active filtration zone to move through the filter faster. We expect the filter to fail faster than for a filter filled with smaller sand grains.

The results of these experiments could hold major significance for filtration methods of AguaClara and other water filtration plants. If it is discovered that sand grain size does impact filter performance, the team can determine the sand grain size that optimizes effluent turbidity and failure time. Using this type of sand in future sand filters could increase filter duration; filters would need to be backwashed less often. This would increase efficiency by saving both time and resources.

The previous models proposed by StaRS Filter Theory teams was focused on combining information from the previous sand bed research and results from experiments and link the effect of microscopic level physics and macrosopic filter performance. The visual model of constrictions found between the sand grains in the filter was developed by previous StaRS Filter Theory teams from the conclusions of several experimental runs until system failure. Filter failure was defined as the moment when effluent turbidity increases sharply. Kuan-mu Yao (1971) stated that the effectiveness of the filter depended on the size of the flocs. Thus, between experimental runs, the coagulant dosage was varied. Varying coagulant dosage changes the size/volume of flocs, which was theorized to affect filter performance.

The Spring 2018 team focused primarily on changing the density of the particle as well as looking at coagulant dosages. By varying the coagulant dosage this in turn increased the size of the floc particles flowing into the filters. In order to see the effects of the varying constrictions, the Spring 2018 team put red dye in order to visualise the floc sizes flowing into the filter. By measuring the different floc sizes, the team was able to deduce that the size of flocs did effect the performance of the filter. Large coagulant dosages proved to make the performance worse.

To further understand the effect of coagulant dosages, the Fall 2017 team systematically varied dosages in filter runs to determine the effect of coagulant dose on filter performance and failure time. The team ran the set of experiments twice. The first set was done by gradually increasing PACl dosage, labeled ‘step up’. The second set was obtained by decreasing the PACl dosages, labeled ‘step down’. They also found out that backwashing the filter between filter runs for 20 minutes allowed more consistent results. Their findings are better be understood in the following figure (Figure 2). It was concluded from these experiments that at lower coagulant dosages, failure time was prolonged than that for higher coagulant dosages.

The findings of the previous teams are important as the results allow us to choose an accurate range for the coagulant dosages we will use for this semester. Furthermore, it allows us to test different variables to find filter efficiency as well as improving the ripening time of the filters.
