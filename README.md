# StaRSFilterTheory
Repository for Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filter Theory sub-team.

## Team Members
Barbara Oramah:  bio4@cornell.edu  607-882-5795

Lainey Reed: ekr42@cornell.edu   301-346-9905

Emily Spiek:        eas397@cornell.edu   214-687-8397

## Team Goal
Understand the physics of filtration and the failure mechanism in Stacked Rapid Sand Filters in order to model the performance of the filter in existing AguaClara Plants through observing the interactions between influent turbidity, PACl dosage, and floc size.
